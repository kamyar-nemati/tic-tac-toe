## Where is the Game Engine?
You may find the file at '_application/core_'

## Yet to be fixed...
The game is designed in such way to support dynamic board. In other words, to be able to play against the computer (Artificail Intelligence) using a board that can be initiated in different sizes like 3x3 or 4x4. The 3x3 board goes fine. However, the 4x4 board is not that perfect. The first move is always made by the player. The second move is the decision that has to be made by the AI. Computer's move enters a big recursion where it takes a great deal of time to be finished.
